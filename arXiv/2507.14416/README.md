**This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of magnetite nanoparticles, systematically evaluating
a range of force fields against experimental results. We analyze the influence of particle size, temperature, and
surface-adsorbed water molecules on the structural and dynamic prop erties of the nanoparticles. We performed classical
molecular dynamics of nanoparticles and bulk magnetite and utilized density functional theory calculations for bulk
magnetite for comparison. Our results reveal that nanopar- ticle size and the presence of adsorbed water molecules have
a pronounced impact on the density of states. Specifically, as the nanoparticle size is decreased, phonon modes exhibit
significant broadening and softening, which is attributable to reduced phonon lifetimes resulting from enhanced boundary
scattering. The incorporation of water further broadens the density of states and extends the spectra to higher energy
regions. Temperature variations result in a slight broadening and softening of the phonon density of states,
particularly in the oxygen-dominated region, which is attributed to phonon anharmonicity.**
